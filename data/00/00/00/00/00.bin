  |   Since its birth in 1993, the Samurai Spirits series has been known    |
  |   as the premier weapon-based versus fighting games, and was            |
  |   essential in cultivating the weapon-based fighting game genre. As     |

  |   Spirits is aiming to yet again push boundaries and deliver some       |

  |   * Exhilarating Weapons-Based Combat - Samurai Spirits carries on      |
  |     the legacy of the tense battles the series is known for, where      |

  |                                                                         |
